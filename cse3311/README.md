## Building off of Tekolio

My group and I adapted this code and built off of it from [Tekolio](https://tekolio.com/how-to-build-a-movie-app-in-react-using-tmdb-api/), specifically [Ateev Duggal](https://github.com/Ateevduggal/The-Movie-Central) who wrote the article and the code baseline for the project.

## The BingeSpot Website

Open [The BingeSpot](https://thebingespot.vercel.app/) to start browsing movies and tv shows.

## Project

We adpated this project and built upon it from [Tekolio](https://tekolio.com/how-to-build-a-movie-app-in-react-using-tmdb-api/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser locally.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
